# Work left to be done

* June 8 2022
  * We need to finalize exactly what tasks we expect the users to do and how we expect that they will do it.
  * We need to finalize the look of the Gravity Spy zooniverse subject that the volunteers see. How are we combining the images when uploading
      i.e. last time we noticed how "frequency coincidence" was a much more challenging visual proposition 
      and would it make more sense to line up the main channel omega scan horizontally (in frequency) as opposed to vertically (in time).
  * Once the above tasks are complete, then we can write the "classification" model which will "reverse engineer" the annotation that the volunteers make
  * and assocaite that classificaton with the Gravity Spy Subject that was classified.
